1. Once the project has been imported in the IDE, we can see a hierarchy of folders as follows:

src/main/java: This is where the source code is placed.

src/main/resources: This folder is used for resources like property or configuration files.

src/test/java: All test code is placed in this folder.

src/main/webapp: We will create a webapp folder for the JSP files, web configuration files and assets like CSS or images etc.

2. Required dependencies
   The spring-boot-starter-web dependency simplifies web development using Spring MVC and an embedded Tomcat server. It includes all the necessary common dependencies, such as the Spring framework, logging, validation, JSON support, and more, with compatible versions pre-configured. This eliminates the need to manage a multitude of dependencies and ensures smoother development compared to traditional Spring MVC applications.
